What is FairPlay? âš½ As every good Brazilian, just like you, we love playing soccer. With friends, colleagues, and even the folks from the neighborhood. And we know how important it is to maintain friendship on the field, avoiding unnecessary arguments about who got the stronger team.

That's where FairPlay comes into play, being your ideal partner to ensure fair draws and balanced teams. Our website was created with the practicality you seek to organize your soccer games of the week. With just a few clicks, you can quickly and easily conduct draws, without wasting time arguing about team formations.

FairPlay offers two draw options: balanced and random. If you want to ensure more evenly matched matches, the balanced draw is the right choice. If the idea is a more relaxed competition, the random draw is the perfect option for surprises and fun.

Be the hero of organization in the friendly soccer games. Let's play soccer!
